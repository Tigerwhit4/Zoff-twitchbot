To make it join your channel and ready for adding, type ```!join``` in zoffbot's channel, and go to your channel on ZÃ¶ff (the same as your username.)

For example, if my username is KasperRT, go to http://zoff.no/kasperrt to listen to the music that your viewers are adding.

To add a song, simply type in your channel ```!request [YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID]``` (without the [] ofc, and a real YouTube ID)
