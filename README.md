# Zoff-twitchbot 
=======

To make it join your channel and ready for adding, type ```!join``` in zoffbot's channel, and go to your channel on ZÃ¶ff (the same as your username.)

For example, if my username is KasperRT, go to http://zoff.no/kasperrt to listen to the music that your viewers are adding.

To add a song, simply type in your channel ```!request [YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID]``` (without the [] ofc, and a real YouTube ID)

(its not possible to get the bot to join any other channels than the one your username is for now. It will be updated soon)

(the code is messy and shitty because I "rewrote" an old bot from when we started Java at NTNU. This will also be cleaned up a bit in the future)

Thanks to nkzawa for the great Socket.io java library.
